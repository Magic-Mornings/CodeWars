This month we will solve code katas selected from codewars.com. It is not the goal to solve all the katas. Just pick one that interests you, and if you solve it in time, pick another. Also feel free to search through codewars.com if none of the challenges below pique your interest.

At 12:00PM we will break, share our code, and discuss any insights/roadblocks we came across while working through the katas.

We can only learn so much in a day. The goal is to internalize problem-solving skills that we can apply to every new challenge we face. From one thing, know ten thousand things...
